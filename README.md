# Neo Retro Station

This is a SF2 format sound bank that features every type of synth patches. Unlike 90RV or LightSolaris, this will be 100% synth patches instead. Toy Keyboard-style patches may be included as well.

Unless stated, every synth made by me, via either ZynAddSubFX, Dexed, or Surge.

Wavetables from **my handdrawn** and **AKWF** Free Waveforms.

PCM Samples will be used from **VSCO-2 CE, VCSL, FreePats, Karoryfer, or any one of authorized CC0/Public Domain Sources** (Meaning neither samples from other SoundFonts, NOR unknown source samples will be used to guarantee **Copyright Safe**, unlike **PrismOfCavesGM**). So no any plugins like k1v is allowed for this.
